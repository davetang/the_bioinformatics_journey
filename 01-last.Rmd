# My last option

I'd imagine that most people have some sort of a plan before they enter
university. It doesn't have to be an elaborate plan; it could be as
straightforward as "when I finish my undergraduate degree, I want to work for a
company and work my way up from there!" I had no plan. Picking what degree to
enrol in consisted of my mum and I looking through the course catalogue and
picking something that was not business-related. In her mind, a business degree
is useless because having started her own successful fast food business, she
believes that doing business is just common sense. We decided on a Bachelor of
Science degree, just because.
