I have always wanted to write a book. Several things have stopped me, one of
which is the pure vanity of the endeavour. Another reason is that I am a poor
writer. But probably the main reason was that I simply lacked the discipline
required for writing a book, decent or otherwise. Believe it or not, I have
actually been asked twice to write a book. The first time was to write a book on
machine learning, which I felt (and still feel) inadequate writing. The second
time was to write a book on R and bioinformatics, which I actually agreed on
writing. However while preparing the structure of the book, I realised that a
lot of what I wanted to write about is already freely available. So I dropped
the project and decided then that anything I will write in the future will be
freely available.

Have I finally gained enough self-discipline to write a book? I guess we will
see!

Finally, the title is simply a substitution of the word Dangerous with
Bioinformatics from the book [The Dangerous
Journey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7967538-the-dangerous-journey) by
Tove Jansson. It's a children's book about a little girl who enters an exciting
world full of wacky, wild, and weird things. Kinda like bioinformatics.

## Why this book {-}

I'd like to share my story of how I ended up working in bioinformatics in the
hopes that it will be useful to those who are planning on starting a career in
bioinformatics (or in some other area of work). I come from a low-income family
and was the first in my family to have attended university. On top of this, I
grew up in an isolated and exotic island, called Papua New Guinea, in a highly
dysfunctional family. I learned most of life's most important lessons the hard
way and if I can prevent at least one person from making the same mistakes that
I have, I'd consider this book a success.

## Structure {-}

I have tentatively structured the book based on different positions I have held,
starting from an Honours student to my current position.
