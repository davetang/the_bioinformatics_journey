# Prologue {-}

In the final year of primary school we had to write what we wanted to be for the yearbook. I remember this well because I had no idea and I asked others what they had written. Many kids wrote "to follow in my father's footsteps". My father didn't leave me any footsteps to follow, so this was out of question. Some wrote "doctor", "laywer", "some respected profession", etc. Some wrote along the lines of getting rich and I knew that would be nice but it never crossed my mind. I didn't want to write what others had written so I gave it some thought and wrote "to live to 99 years old". A kid named Ralph told me that he would visit me the day before my 100th birthday and murder me. Mrs. O'Sullivan was playfully shocked and I told Ralph that I looked forward to seeing him then.

I've never had much guidance in my life and as you'll read, I never planned for a career of any sort. I went to university because my family thought it was important. I studied biology because I liked my tenth grade biology teacher. I studied bioinformatics because I didn't have any other choice. And despite my chaotic life, everything worked out OK. Have you ever dined at a Chinese restaurant in a foreign country and saw a kid, who is not supposed to working there, working? That's me and that's how I spent most of my childhood. I would have never imagined being any sort of professional. Actually, I wouldn't have known what to imagine...
