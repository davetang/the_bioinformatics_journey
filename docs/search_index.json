[["index.html", "The Bioinformatics Journey Preface", " The Bioinformatics Journey Dave Tang 2023-07-24 Preface “How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.” — Henry David Thoreau I have always wanted to write a book. Several things have stopped me, one of which is the pure vanity of the endeavour. Another reason is that I am a poor writer. But probably the main reason was that I simply lacked the discipline required for writing a book, decent or otherwise. Believe it or not, I have actually been asked twice to write a book. The first time was to write a book on machine learning, which I felt (and still feel) inadequate writing. The second time was to write a book on R and bioinformatics, which I actually agreed on writing. However while preparing the structure of the book, I realised that a lot of what I wanted to write about is already freely available. So I dropped the project and decided then that anything I will write in the future will be freely available. Despite all my reasons, I still want to write because I like writing and I’ll never get better at writing if I don’t write more. Also, I can’t keep waiting for the right moment to write because there isn’t one. Finally, the title is simply a substitution of the word Dangerous with Bioinformatics from the book The Dangerous Journey by Tove Jansson. It’s a children’s book about a little girl who enters an exciting world full of wacky, wild, and weird things. Kinda like bioinformatics. "],["why-this-book.html", "Why this book", " Why this book I’d like to share my story of how I ended up working in bioinformatics in the hopes that it will be useful to those who are planning on starting a career in bioinformatics (or in some other area of work). I come from a low-income family and was the first in my family to have attended university. On top of this, I grew up in an isolated and exotic island, called Papua New Guinea, in a highly dysfunctional family. I learned most of life’s most important lessons the hard way and if I can prevent at least one person from making the same mistakes that I have, I’d consider this book a success. One of my biggest problem in life is not seeking help when I need it because it’s not something I learned to do. This is one reason why I have mostly learned things the hard way. There is value in this but it’s a major impedance in terms of time because it not only stops you from achieving what you want but it also takes time to bounce back mentally. To the old adage of what doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger, which is attributed to Friedrich Nietzsche, you may become stronger but it can also leave you disheartened and jaded. I also like to write because it gives me an opportunity to self-reflect. I think it’s important to evaluate your current situtation from time to time. Therefore, even if no one reads this apart from myself, it will have served one purpose. Now, I will probably read what I’ve written in the future and cringe. If I’m lucky enough to get someone else reading this, they may read this today and cringe. I think I’m fine with that because what I write reflects who I am right now. I may outgrow these opinions in the future and that’s part of learning and moving on. It’s like looking back at code you’ve written many years ago and being in disbelief at how bad it is. But this is an indication that you’ve improved!

"],["about-the-author.html", "About the author", " About the author Dave Tang is a bioinformatician who is known for his blog. He earned his PhD from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He is still actively blogging about bioinformatics (mostly). He used to play a lot of basketball but nowadays his time is mainly split between work and family. "],["my-last-option.html", "Chapter 1 My last option", " Chapter 1 My last option I’d imagine that most people have some sort of a plan before they enter university. It doesn’t have to be an elaborate plan; it could be as straightforward as “when I finish my undergraduate degree, I want to work for a company and work my way up from there!” I had no plan. Picking what degree to enrol in consisted of my mum and I looking through the course catalogue and picking something that was not business-related. In her mind, a business degree is useless because having started her own successful fast food business, she believes that doing business is just common sense. We decided on a Bachelor of Science degree, just because. And we never seriously considered what I was going to do after I graduated. You may be reading this and thinking what kind of a person spends a fortune paying for university (barely affording it) without considering the potential upsides? Well, have you ever read about some scam and found asking yourself who would ever fall for such a scheme? It’s always the people who don’t know any better. I got into university as a first-generation student and I didn’t do very well but I managed to graduate. I don’t want to make up excuses for my mediocre grades, so I’ll just say it was because I didn’t work very hard, which is true. My mediocre grades and complete lack of confidence was a problem when it came to finding a lab for an honours degree. To those not familiar with the undergraduate system in Australia (and don’t want to read the Wikipedia article I linked), an honours degree is a one year (in practice, it’s about ten months) undergraduate research program you can take after your Bachelor’s degree and has nothing to do with the traditional meaning of the word “honours”. You can consider it as a shortened Master’s degree and if you do well enough, you can actually commence a PhD, which is what a lot of people do. I wanted to do a honours degree because it provides some practical experience, which would help me find a job, and it would also potentially qualify me to enter a PhD program. I majored in biochemistry and microbiology for my Bachelor of Science degree. I emailed a handful of professors in the school of biochemistry in total. The first two said that they couldn’t accommodate additional students. The next asked for my grades and told me their lab only accepted students with a GPA of 6.5 or higher (7 is the highest), so that was a no. I managed to get a meeting with the next professor but he wasn’t impressed with my grades, especially the grade I got for his class. I had one last meeting and it was with a bioinformatics lab working on phylogenetics. It was my last shot. I still remember the meeting I had with Mark and Rob (Mark’s new postdoc). Out of all my subjects, the best grade I got was for a course called Genomics and Bioinformatics (BIOL3004). I didn’t work especially harder for this subject so perhaps it was a sign that that’s where my skills are at. I milked it for all it was worth to Mark and Rob since the rest of my grades were rubbish. They worked on microbial phylogenetics, so I also mentioned my microbiology major. In the end, it all came down to a single question. Mark asked Rob whether he had the time to supervise me because he didn’t. I stared at Rob. And he casually said “Yeah”. "],["second-wind.html", "1.1 Second wind", " 1.1 Second wind I remember saying to myself at the start of honours that I’ve been granted a second chance to prove myself and I would therefore make the most out of it by working really really hard and getting a 1st class honours. Then I could only show people my honours grade, which would effectively bypass my abysmal grades. That was wishful thinking. I literally jumped into the deep end of bioinformatics. In my Bachelor of Science degree, I did not take a single computing or mathematics course and I had no prior programming exposure (apart from writing some HTML, which doesn’t count). Despite being determined to work hard, it was difficult and almost impossible for me to learn because what was supposed to be introductory material was completely incomprehensible. I recall joining the first lab meeting where they were discussing about these things called Markov clusters, which even when I considered as separate words, had no idea what they were. But the thing that was the major problem was that I didn’t ask for help because first I didn’t want to bother anyone and second I didn’t have the self confidence to admit that I didn’t know something. It’s easy to lose focus and determination when nothing you read makes any sense. I tried coming into the lab on the weekends to read papers but I couldn’t make any sense of them. The only thing that kept my attention was learning Unix and Perl because it was hands on and I was good at hacking (not the type of hacking where you break into computer systems by exploiting weaknesses but the type where you use something in a way that it wasn’t designed for) and Perl was (unfortunately) perfect for that. Back then you couldn’t look up Stack Overflow so you just kept trying stuff. Maybe if I didn’t use Perl, I wouldn’t have gotten anything done in my honours year. "],["redemption.html", "Chapter 2 Redemption", " Chapter 2 Redemption 09/08/2006 Subject: CSIRO Work experience program Dear Dr. Dalrymple, My name is Dave Tang, a Bachelor of Science graduate currently without a science job. I’ve had difficulty looking for work as a scientist after my brief work at The University of Queensland ceased, partly because I’m stuck in the middle of two fields. I finished my Bachelor of Science degree with majors in microbiology and biochemistry and I’ve completed an honours degree in bioinformatics. However, I don’t have the programming/mathematical background to strongly state that I am a bioinformatian nor enough laboratory experience to call myself a laboratory scientist and this has been a problem. Naturally I searched CSIRO to see if there were any positions available. Though there was nothing suitable, I was happy to see that there is a work experience program for people with little or no work experience. I believe my interest lies more into bioinformatics and thus I would like to get more experience in this area. Your details came up as one of the principal investigators in bioinformatics at CSIRO. I entered bioinformatics with minimal knowledge about the field and didn’t have any programming knowledge. It was required for my research project to know a little bit of programming and I managed to learn some Perl and UNIX. My research project was involved with detecting lateral gene transfer events among a group of bacteria. I’ve had some experience working with genomes and looking for SNPs, although not to the magnitude of eukaryotic genomes. It would be one of the biggest joys to be able to gain some work experience in your lab. I am really sincere about honing my skills in this area and this would be a tremendous opportunity. I have included my CV and in it two referees, although your time and availability would be deciding factors, I kindly ask if you could consider my application. I thank you for your time and look forward to hearing your reply. Sincerely, Dave Tang It is no exaggeration that the email above changed my life. It was a honest and desperate plea after being unsuccessful in all of my job applications. At that time there were no open positions for any bioinformatics roles. The only available positions I could find that were kind of science related were the following: Master Foods Graduate Program Junior Microbiologist Soil Technician Laboratory Assistant Research Assistant Bioprocessing Assistant Scientist Amcor Australasia Graduate Program Australian Communications and Media Authority Graduate Program Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Graduate Development Programme I have a folder on my Hotmail account called “Rejected work”, that holds all the rejection emails I received from applying to the positions above. When Brian replied my email saying that he was interested and wanted to talk about possibilities, it was one of the happiest days of my life. I didn’t even care that they didn’t pay me. But of course I had to work 9-to-5 on Saturday and Sunday to make ends meet. I kept this up for five months, the duration of my work experience programme.
