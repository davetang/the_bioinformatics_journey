[["index.html", "The Bioinformatics Journey Preface", " The Bioinformatics Journey Dave Tang 2024-08-09 Preface “How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.” — Henry David Thoreau I have always wanted to write a book. Several things have stopped me, one of which is the pure vanity of the endeavour. Another reason is that I am a poor writer. But probably the main reason was that I simply lacked the discipline required for writing a book, decent or otherwise. Believe it or not, I have actually been asked twice to write a book. The first time was to write a book on machine learning, which I felt (and still feel) inadequate writing. The second time was to write a book on R and bioinformatics, which I actually agreed on writing. However while preparing the structure of the book, I realised that a lot of what I wanted to write about is already freely available. So I dropped the project and decided then that anything I will write in the future will be freely available. Despite all my reasons, I still want to write because I like writing and I’ll never get better at writing if I don’t write more. Also, I can’t keep waiting for the right moment to write because there isn’t one. Finally, the title is simply a substitution of the word Dangerous with Bioinformatics from the book The Dangerous Journey by Tove Jansson. It’s a children’s book about a little girl who enters an exciting world full of wacky, wild, and weird things. Kinda like bioinformatics. "],["why-this-book.html", "Why this book", " Why this book I’d like to share my story of how I ended up working in bioinformatics in the hopes that it will be useful to those who are planning on starting a career in bioinformatics (or in some other area of work). I come from a low-income family and was the first in my family to have attended university. On top of this, I grew up in an isolated and exotic island, called Papua New Guinea, in a highly dysfunctional family. I learned most of life’s most important lessons the hard way and if I can prevent at least one person from making the same mistakes that I have, I’d consider this book a success. One of my biggest problem in life is not seeking help when I need it because it’s not something I learned to do. This is one reason why I have mostly learned things the hard way. There is value in this but it’s a major impedance in terms of time because it not only stops you from achieving what you want but it also takes time to bounce back mentally. To the old adage of what doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger, which is attributed to Friedrich Nietzsche, you may become stronger but it can also leave you disheartened and jaded. I also like to write because it gives me an opportunity to self-reflect. I think it’s important to evaluate your current situtation from time to time. Therefore, even if no one reads this apart from myself, it will have served one purpose. Now, I will probably read what I’ve written in the future and cringe. If I’m lucky enough to get someone else reading this, they may read this today and cringe. I think I’m fine with that because what I write reflects who I am right now. I may outgrow these opinions in the future and that’s part of learning and moving on. It’s like looking back at code you’ve written many years ago and being in disbelief at how bad it is. But this is an indication that you’ve improved! "],["structure.html", "Structure", " Structure I have tentatively structured the book based on different positions I have held, starting from an Honours student to my current position. "],["about-the-author.html", "About the author", " About the author Dave Tang is a bioinformatician who is known for his blog. He earned his PhD from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He is still actively blogging about bioinformatics (mostly). He used to play a lot of basketball but nowadays his time is mainly split between work and family. "],["prologue.html", "Prologue", " Prologue In the final year of primary school we had to write a short sentence describing what we wanted to be in the future for the yearbook. I remember this task well because I was stumped; I had no idea because I never thought about what I wanted to be or what I could be. Naturally, I looked at what my classmates and friends had written. I recall that my best friend wrote “doctor” and indeed he eventually became a medical doctor. He was easily the smartest kid in school, so no one had any doubt that he wouldn’t become a doctor. I had always envied the fact that his mum was a teacher (although I probably wouldn’t have enjoyed being him in his strict family). A lot of kids wrote that they wanted to “follow in my father’s footsteps” and at that time I had no idea what that meant because I had never heard of the phrase before; I thought that they wanted to literally follow their father when they walked together and I thought that was a silly thing to write. I also recall that a few of my friends wanted to be a millionaire or be rich. While I agreed at that time that being rich would be nice, especially since my family was quite poor, it didn’t cross my mind. Eventually after some thought I wrote “to live to 99 years old” because I thought it was funny. A nice kid named Ralph saw what I had written and told me that he would visit me the day before my 100th birthday to murder me because he didn’t want me to unfulfill my dream. Mrs. O’Sullivan (my favourite teacher) was playfully shocked and I told Ralph that I looked forward to seeing him then. "],["my-last-option.html", "Chapter 1 My last option", " Chapter 1 My last option I’d imagine that most people have some sort of a plan before they enter university. It doesn’t have to be an elaborate plan; it could be as straightforward as “when I finish my undergraduate degree, I want to work for a company and work my way up from there!” I had no plan. Picking what degree to enrol in consisted of my mum and I looking through the course catalogue and picking something that was not business-related. In her mind, a business degree is useless because having started her own successful fast food business, she believes that doing business is just common sense. We decided on a Bachelor of Science degree, just because. And we never seriously considered what I was going to do after I graduated. You may be reading this and thinking what kind of a person spends a fortune paying for university (barely affording it) without considering the potential upsides? Well, have you ever read about some scam and found asking yourself who would ever fall for such a scheme? It’s always the people who don’t know any better. I got into university as a first-generation student and I didn’t do very well but I managed to graduate. I don’t want to make up excuses for my mediocre grades, so I’ll just say it was because I didn’t work very hard, which is true. My mediocre grades and complete lack of confidence was a problem when it came to finding a lab for an honours degree. To those not familiar with the undergraduate system in Australia (and don’t want to read the Wikipedia article I linked), an honours degree is a one year (in practice, it’s about ten months) undergraduate research program you can take after your Bachelor’s degree and has nothing to do with the traditional meaning of the word “honours”. You can consider it as a shortened Master’s degree and if you do well enough, you can actually commence a PhD, which is what a lot of people do. I wanted to do a honours degree because it provides some practical experience, which would help me find a job, and it would also potentially qualify me to enter a PhD program. I majored in biochemistry and microbiology for my Bachelor of Science degree. I emailed a handful of professors in the school of biochemistry in total. The first two said that they couldn’t accommodate additional students. The next asked for my grades and told me their lab only accepted students with a GPA of 6.5 or higher (7 is the highest), so that was a no. I managed to get a meeting with the next professor but he wasn’t impressed with my grades, especially the grade I got for his class. I had one last meeting and it was with a bioinformatics lab working on phylogenetics. It was my last shot. I still remember the meeting I had with Mark and Rob (Mark’s new postdoc). Out of all my subjects, the best grade I got was for a course called Genomics and Bioinformatics (BIOL3004). I didn’t work especially harder for this subject so perhaps it was a sign that that’s where my skills are at. I milked it for all it was worth to Mark and Rob since the rest of my grades were rubbish. They worked on microbial phylogenetics, so I also mentioned my microbiology major. In the end, it all came down to a single question. Mark asked Rob whether he had the time to supervise me because he didn’t. I stared at Rob and was probably holding my breath. And he casually said “Yeah”. "],["second-wind.html", "1.1 Second wind", " 1.1 Second wind I remember saying to myself at the start of honours that I’ve been granted a second chance to prove myself and I would therefore make the most out of it by working really really hard and getting a 1st class honours. Then I could only show people my honours grade, which would effectively bypass my abysmal grades. That was wishful thinking. I literally jumped into the deep end of bioinformatics. In my Bachelor of Science degree, I did not take a single computing or mathematics course and I had no prior programming exposure (apart from writing some HTML, which doesn’t count). Despite being determined to work hard, it was difficult and almost impossible for me to learn because what was supposed to be introductory material was completely incomprehensible. I recall joining the first lab meeting where they were discussing about these things called Markov clusters, which even when I considered as separate words, had no idea what they were. But the thing that was the major problem was that I didn’t ask for help because first I didn’t want to bother anyone and second I didn’t have the self confidence to admit that I didn’t know something. It’s easy to lose focus and determination when nothing you read makes any sense. I tried coming into the lab on the weekends to read papers but I couldn’t make any sense of them. The only thing that kept my attention was learning Unix and Perl because it was hands on and I was good at hacking (not the type of hacking where you break into computer systems by exploiting weaknesses but the type where you use something in a way that it wasn’t designed for) and Perl was (unfortunately) perfect for that. Back then you couldn’t look up Stack Overflow so you just kept trying stuff. Maybe if I didn’t use Perl, I wouldn’t have gotten anything done in my honours year. "],["the-last-week-of-honours.html", "1.2 The last week of Honours", " 1.2 The last week of Honours I have shared a copy of my Honours thesis on GitHub. It’s not something that I’m really proud of because I always felt like I could have done so much better. And that’s a recurring theme for me: always thinking that I could do better. But now that I look back, I don’t think I could do better because I didn’t have the discipline to gradually improve myself. I used to skip classes to go play basketball. I always studied for exams the night before. I did assignments the day before it was due or sometimes on the day it was due. For my Honours thesis, even the part of me that makes me think I can do things the night before thought it would be crazy to attempt to finish it in one night. So I gave myself about a week to start writing. I had done most of the analyses and I knew what to write for my thesis but as usual, I could never get myself to work on something well in advance. I just gave this some thought and I think the main reason I worked like that is because I was foolishly overconfident. And like a fool I handicapped myself for no good reason. I had nothing written and I think I started writing up almost a whole year’s worth of work on a Sunday night to be handed in on either Thursday or Friday. If it weren’t for Rob, I would not have graduated. The last week is kinda a blur because it’s been a while and I’m writing this from memory, and also because I did not sleep much. I was living with my friend at the time and I moved my computer out to the living room. I did this because we had put a spare mattress out in the open (which we put there so that we could laze around in front of the TV) and I told him to make sure that I didn’t sleep too much because I needed to write. I remember sleeping for an average of 2-3 hours each day and in the end I don’t think I needed him to wake me up. I don’t remember what I did for food. I don’t remember what my friend was doing or said to me. I don’t remember much except that I was busy writing and sending Rob my drafts at ungodly hours and he would return my drafts with corrections and suggestions at the same ungodly hours! I felt terrible that I took him along with my mad rush. I didn’t have any other choice but to bother him. I remember certain events on the day of the deadline. I went into the lab because I needed to print my thesis out and get it binded. I remember seeing Rob and he said I looked terrible, which was probably the case. He might have offered me some of his own self-made coffee and I probably had some; he was nice like that. I remember walking to the biochemistry building, seeing some of the other Honours students, and handed in three copies of my thesis. I think I went home right after. I don’t remember. I missed out on a 1st class Honours by a few percent and got the second best grade. I wasn’t happy because everyone I knew got 1st class Honours. But in retrospect it wasn’t a bad grade given my circumstances. I wrote Rob an email thanking him sincerely and also joked that I needed to work on my time management skills to which he agreed on in his reply. He also wrote something I will never forget. I think I had asked him why he stayed up and worked with me during the last week because that was way beyond his duty. He said he wouldn’t have wanted to see me fail like that. "],["redemption.html", "Chapter 2 Redemption", " Chapter 2 Redemption 09/08/2006 Subject: CSIRO Work experience program Dear Dr. Dalrymple, My name is Dave Tang, a Bachelor of Science graduate currently without a science job. I’ve had difficulty looking for work as a scientist after my brief work at The University of Queensland ceased, partly because I’m stuck in the middle of two fields. I finished my Bachelor of Science degree with majors in microbiology and biochemistry and I’ve completed an honours degree in bioinformatics. However, I don’t have the programming/mathematical background to strongly state that I am a bioinformatian nor enough laboratory experience to call myself a laboratory scientist and this has been a problem. Naturally I searched CSIRO to see if there were any positions available. Though there was nothing suitable, I was happy to see that there is a work experience program for people with little or no work experience. I believe my interest lies more into bioinformatics and thus I would like to get more experience in this area. Your details came up as one of the principal investigators in bioinformatics at CSIRO. I entered bioinformatics with minimal knowledge about the field and didn’t have any programming knowledge. It was required for my research project to know a little bit of programming and I managed to learn some Perl and UNIX. My research project was involved with detecting lateral gene transfer events among a group of bacteria. I’ve had some experience working with genomes and looking for SNPs, although not to the magnitude of eukaryotic genomes. It would be one of the biggest joys to be able to gain some work experience in your lab. I am really sincere about honing my skills in this area and this would be a tremendous opportunity. I have included my CV and in it two referees, although your time and availability would be deciding factors, I kindly ask if you could consider my application. I thank you for your time and look forward to hearing your reply. Sincerely, Dave Tang It is no exaggeration that the email above changed my life. It was a honest and desperate plea after being unsuccessful in all of my job applications. At that time there were no open positions for any bioinformatics roles. The only available positions I could find that were kind of science related were the following: Master Foods Graduate Program Junior Microbiologist Soil Technician Laboratory Assistant Research Assistant Bioprocessing Assistant Scientist Amcor Australasia Graduate Program Australian Communications and Media Authority Graduate Program Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Graduate Development Programme I have a folder on my Hotmail account called “Rejected work”, that holds all the rejection emails I received from applying to the positions above. When Brian replied my email saying that he was interested and wanted to talk about possibilities, it was one of the happiest days of my life. I didn’t even care that they didn’t pay me. But of course I had to work 9-to-5 on Saturday and Sunday to make ends meet. I kept this up for five months, the duration of my work experience programme. "],["wes.html", "2.1 Wes", " 2.1 Wes When I was at CSIRO I was under the tutelage1 of Wes, who was the sys admin and bioinformatician for Brian’s group. I was a bit nervous when I first met Wes because he had a stern demeanour. The first thing he asked me to do was to write a Perl script to convert one file format to another. I went back to my office, wrote it quickly, and returned to show him what I had done. He was impressed and said he had to come up with more difficult tasks for me to do. And that’s how we worked during most of my “internship”: he would assign me a task and I’ll write a Perl script that would complete the task. But the thing that was the most beneficial was that he would take the time to go through my code line by line with me and suggest how he would tackle the problem. He never told me that his way was the right or better way, only that it was how he would do it but I always did it his way because it was better. And this was how I gradually got better and better in Perl, which at that time was what a lot of people used for bioinformatics. I was extremely motivated and diligent during my work experience because once again I felt like I was given another chance; I had to make the most out of it. However when my time was almost up, it wasn’t clear whether they had funding for me and I was getting tired of working two jobs mostly because I couldn’t play basketball with my friends/team. I actually didn’t want to expect anything because I didn’t want to be disappointed. But when Brian told me they had funding for me for at least a year, I was ecstatic! I was going to make a living as a scientist! I remember telling Wes that they had hired me and he said with a smile: “What!? Against all my recommendations!” I’m forever grateful to Brian and Wes because they gave me the confidence to become a bioinformatian. I’m getting ahead of myself but when my time was up at CSIRO and I managed to get a new job as a bioinformatian at The University of Queensland (UQ), I wrote a long email thanking Wes. I still remember his reply although I can’t find a copy of his email. He told me that he was happy to have been my mentor and that sadly not that many people have the enterprise to learn even though he was always willing to teach. He made me feel like giving myself a little bit of credit. And that was the last thing and maybe the most important thing he bestowed on me. I learned the word “tutelage” from Brian and I had never seen it until I read a document written by him. To use it here is extra special to me.↩︎ "],["research-assistant.html", "Chapter 3 Research assistant", " Chapter 3 Research assistant Phasellus semper nec lectus eget maximus.
