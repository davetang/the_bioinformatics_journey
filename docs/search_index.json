[["index.html", "The Bioinformatics Journey Preface", " The Bioinformatics Journey Dave Tang 2023-06-30 Preface “How vain it is to sit down to write when you have not stood up to live.” — Henry David Thoreau I have always wanted to write a book. Several things have stopped me, one of which is the pure vanity of the endeavour. Another reason is that I am a poor writer. But probably the main reason was that I simply lacked the discipline required for writing a book, decent or otherwise. Believe it or not, I have actually been asked twice to write a book. The first time was to write a book on machine learning, which I felt (and still feel) inadequate writing. The second time was to write a book on R and bioinformatics, which I actually agreed on writing. However while preparing the structure of the book, I realised that a lot of what I wanted to write about is already freely available. So I dropped the project and decided then that anything I will write in the future will be freely available. Have I finally gained enough self-discipline to write a book? I guess we will see! Finally, the title is simply a substitution of the word Dangerous with Bioinformatics from the book The Dangerous Journey by Tove Jansson. It’s a children’s book about a little girl who enters an exciting world full of wacky, wild, and weird things. Kinda like bioinformatics. "],["why-this-book.html", "Why this book", " Why this book I’d like to share my story of how I ended up working in bioinformatics in the hopes that it will be useful to those who are planning on starting a career in bioinformatics (or in some other area of work). I come from a low-income family and was the first in my family to have attended university. On top of this, I grew up in an isolated and exotic island, called Papua New Guinea, in a highly dysfunctional family. I learned most of life’s most important lessons the hard way and if I can prevent at least one person from making the same mistakes that I have, I’d consider this book a success.

"],["about-the-author.html", "About the author", " About the author Dave Tang is a bioinformatician who is known for his blog. He earned his PhD from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He is still actively blogging about bioinformatics (mostly). He used to play a lot of basketball but nowadays his time is mainly split between work and family. "],["my-last-option.html", "Chapter 1 My last option", " Chapter 1 My last option I’d imagine that most people have some sort of a plan before they enter university. It doesn’t have to be an elaborate plan; it could be as straightforward as “when I finish my undergraduate degree, I want to work for a company and work my way up from there!” I had no plan. Picking what degree to enrol in consisted of my mum and I looking through the course catalogue and picking something that was not business-related. In her mind, a business degree is useless because having started her own successful fast food business, she believes that doing business is just common sense. We decided on a Bachelor of Science degree, just because. "],["redemption.html", "Chapter 2 Redemption", " Chapter 2 Redemption Morbi vitae libero ac nunc blandit viverra.
